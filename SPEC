# SPEC Version 1

Users and Groups are access holding objects.

acl
 - /documentA
   - privileges 'rwsdc'
 - /


a nested document structure can be access, as the document itself knows
it's location.

documentX
path: Folder:ID/Folder:ID1/Webpage:ID2,Folder:ID4/Webpage:ID3

If looking up for children of Folder:ID, the pathd


DocumentInformation Collection stores access and path privileges

documentA has a unique ID

this ID is stored as documentID in the DocumentInformation object along
with documentType, path array and access privileges.

not every document is added to the acl of the user
if a user is the document's creator they will allways be able to access it
